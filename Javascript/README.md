 JavaScript is a high level dynamic, untyped and interpreted programming language standardized in the ECMAScript language specification, that alongside HTML and CSS is one of the three core technologies of world wide web content. <br>
 In short, JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to write small programs that run in the browser, and change the HTML and CSS of the current document. <br>
 The language was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScripts and finally to JavaScripts when Netscape and Sun Microsystems did a licensing agreement that included the language.
