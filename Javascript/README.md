 JavaScript is a high level dynamic, untyped and interpreted programming language standardized in the ECMAScript language specification, that alongside HTML and CSS is one of the three core technologies of world wide web content. <br>
 In short, JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to write small programs that run in the browser, and change the HTML and CSS of the current document. <br>
 The language was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScripts and finally to JavaScripts when Netscape and Sun Microsystems did a licensing agreement that included the language. <br>
 Because JavaScript may change to HTML in CSS on a page, any time a browser encounters a JavaScript file reference it stops the rendering of the page until the script file is downloaded and executed. This is known as JavaScript render blocking and it can slow down the performance of a site significantly <br>
  If we load our JavaScript file asynchronously by adding the async attribute, the file will be downloaded alongside the HTML and render blocking only kicks in when the script is executed. It's better, and useful in some situations. If we defer the script, loading and execution of the file, even if it's referenced in the head, only happens when everything else is loaded. <br>
