# Structure
1. HTML pages are text documents.
2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angledbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotesthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us moreabout the content of that element.
6. Attributes require a name and a value.
7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# Text
1. HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
2. They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).


# List
1. There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
2. Ordered lists use numbers.
3. Unordered lists use bullets.
4. Definition lists are used to define terminology.
5. Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Links
1. Links are created using the a element.
2. The a element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
3. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
4. You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
5. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
