/*The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets â€” these are called HTML elements*/
/* Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag*/
/*Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags*/
